# Sea Of Thieves Fleet Timer

Those who play Sea Of Thieves know this. During fleet building on Discord channels, one of the players counts down from three or five and tries to click the "Set Sail" button at the same time in order to end up on the same server. Depending on the luck factor and everyone being able to click at the same time, they keep trying. Until they end up on the same server.

At this point I thought about what I could do and turned this process into a program that displays the UTC time on the screen. Players decide on a time zone among themselves. They enter the hours, minutes and seconds (according to UTC time) and click the start button. At this point, the only thing to do is to keep the mouse cursor ready on the "Set Sail" button. When the entered time is up, all players click within the same millisecond.
